# Basic API Rest to manage products

This is a backend project for an API Rest to manage stock products. It has a Frontend client developed on React with Typescript and Tailwind, Valibot to validate schemas, React Router Dom v6.4, useFetcher for HTTP comunication withou redirection.

For the backend I have used Express, PostgreSQL database, Sequelize ORM, SuperTest for testing practice and Swagger for documentation practice.

## ATENTION

Please clone this repositirie to probe it, then you have to install all dependencies with `npm i` on client and server folders.

You must to create a postgresql database too, I have one on Render for example.
